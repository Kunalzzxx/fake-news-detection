Fake News Detection is an advanced computational project that aims to distinguish between legitimate news and misinformation by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning techniques.

Fake news detection involves analyzing news content (articles, headlines, or social media posts) to identify its authenticity. The system evaluates text features such as linguistic patterns, sentiment, and source credibility to classify news as real or fake.
